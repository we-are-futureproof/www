# AI Assistant Guidelines

## Project Boundaries

1. **Respect .gitignore:** When working with this project, honor the patterns in the `.gitignore` file. Do not document, suggest modifications to, or consider as part of the codebase any files or directories excluded by `.gitignore`.

2. **Focus on Committed Code:** Primarily work with files that are tracked in version control. These represent the intentional, shared parts of the codebase.

3. **Generated Content:** Recognize that directories like `.next/`, `node_modules/`, and build outputs are not part of the project source code and should be excluded from documentation and analysis.

These guidelines ensure AI assistance remains focused on the actual project code and not on temporary, generated, or environment-specific files.
