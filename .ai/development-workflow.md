# Development Workflow Guide

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- pnpm installed globally (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- Git

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd www
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Access the site at http://localhost:3000

## Development Best Practices

### Code Organization

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Place reusable components in `/components`
   - Place page-specific components in `/components/[page-name]`
   - Use appropriate naming conventions (PascalCase for components)

2. **File Organization**:
   - Keep related files together
   - Use index files for cleaner imports
   - Group by feature rather than file type

3. **Styling Approach**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for most styling
   - Create custom Tailwind components for repeating patterns
   - Use CSS modules only when necessary

### State Management

1. **Component State**:
   - Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for component-level state
   - Keep state as close as possible to where it's used

2. **Shared State**:
   - Use React Context for shared state across components
   - Consider using Zustand for more complex state management

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**:
   - Use dynamic imports for large components
   - Lazy load components not needed for initial render

2. **Image Optimization**:
   - Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
   - Set appropriate sizes and priority

3. **Component Optimization**:
   - Use React.memo for expensive renders
   - Extract event handlers and callbacks with useCallback
   - Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

1. **Main Branches**:
   - `main` - Production-ready code
   - `develop` - Integration branch for features

2. **Feature Branches**:
   - Create feature branches from `develop`
   - Format: `feature/feature-name`
   - Example: `feature/testimonial-carousel`

3. **Hotfix Branches**:
   - Create hotfix branches from `main`
   - Format: `hotfix/issue-description`
   - Example: `hotfix/fix-mobile-navigation`

### Commit Guidelines

1. **Commit Structure**:
   ```
   [TYPE]: Short description (50 chars or less)

   More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.
   ```

2. **Types**:
   - `feat`: New feature
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
   - `docs`: Documentation only changes
   - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Testing**:
   - Test components in isolation with React Testing Library
   - Focus on user interactions rather than implementation details

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test component interactions
   - Test page functionality

3. **E2E Testing**:
   - Use Cypress for end-to-end testing
   - Cover critical user flows

## Deployment Process

1. **Development Workflow**:
   - Develop locally and test
   - Push to feature branch
   - Create pull request to `develop`
   - Review and merge

2. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Merge `develop` to `staging`
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Conduct QA and user acceptance testing

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Merge `staging` to `main`
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Document complex logic with comments
   - Use JSDoc for functions and component props
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

2. **README Maintenance**:
   - Update project README with new features
   - Keep setup instructions current
   - Document breaking changes

3. **Changelog**:
   - Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file
   - Document significant changes in each version
   - Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
